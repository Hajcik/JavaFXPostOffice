# Post Office Application - JavaFX

Post Office application is in a state that can be further expanded. It served as a learning ground for making Java FX application using file manipulation system, using JSON format to load and save data. App loads data in a file that stores data about people, which then lists in a ListView. By clicking cell you can view all the data about selected person.

App provides few functionalities:<br><br>

<b>Add address</b> gives user ability to add new data to the list.<br>
<b>About</b> shows information about the author and short description about the program purpose.<br>
<b>Exit</b> closes the application.<br>
<b>Clicking on ListView cell</b> shows detailed information about a person data. If chosen person has a company - name of it will be displayed as well.

# Development opportunities

Application is in a state that can be greatly improved. It has it's desired functionalities, but it was mostly an attempt to learn mechanics and ideas behind Java and JavaFX library. Knowledge gained in this project will be used in a future and on more elaborate projects.
